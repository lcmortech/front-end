                	<h5>Aug 22, 2025</h4>
                	<p>Yofukashi no Uta is peak. That is all. This week's ep of Osomatsu-san wasn't bad either.</p>
                </article>
				<article>
					<h4>Catching Up on Anime cont.d</h3>
					<h5>Aug 23, 2025</h4>
					<p>I binged Call of the Peak's Paradse Arc. Great stuff! I missed Ko and Anko's aura farming. I'm fine if Nazuna doesn't show and we just a side series with those two tbh. Okay, back to writing stuff, lol. Oh yeah, I'm also currently reading Jeanne Thornton's Summer Fun and I'm loving it so far.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Let's go, GO-MAN!!</h4>
					<h5>Aug 26, 2025</h5>
					<p>I binged Hamish Steele's new graphic novel Go-Man in less than two hours. Oh man, so good! Also, amazing autistic and queer representation as always! I can't believe I hate to wait for the next volume! It was getting so good ðŸ˜­. Oh well, until next time!
						
					P.S: I worked on some music today as well! I'm looking forward to that!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Ordinary Day</h4>
					<h5>Aug 27, 2025</h5>
					<p>I focused mostly on writing music today and body doubling with a friend! I've also been having trouble with MS Rewards more lately. Just a lot of bugginess and false flagging of my points account. Honestly, after almost a decade, I might stop using it. Sucks. Oh well. Until next time i guess!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Precursor to the weekend</h4>
					<h5>Aug 28, 2025</h5>
					<p>I wasn't feeling great today. The bad news is I had to cancel plans I made with a friend. The good news is that I got my copy of Summer Fun! I've also started working more on my music! I'm so excited for where that will go! Talk to you soon!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Much Music, More News!</h4>
					<h5>Aug 29, 2025</h5>
					<p>Came up with more music today! I'm super excited now! Oh yeah, I'm really enjoying my new thermal sticker printer too, and it's fun coming up with new designs! I also started reading One Piece! Oh yeah, wish me luck!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Of Bodies and Health</h4>
					<h5>Aug 30, 2025</h5>
					<p>I went to Hamish Steele's virtual sign up session for Go-Man and it was great! Motivation get! In less steller news, I've been dealing with a particular health issue for a while now that's got me down. It seems like I might need surgery for it sooner than I thought. A friend told me they're sorry I have to have a body when I had to cancel on them bc of the same issue, in reference to AJJ's Body Terror Song. I really appreciated it. I really appreciate my friends.</p>

					<h4>It's Good to Have Friends</h4>
					<h5>Sep 5, 2025</h5>
					<p>I went to a funeral today. It was rough, but at least my friends helped me through it. That's all. I'll prob add more later.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Sep 6, 2025</h4>
					<h5>Day After</h5>
					<p>I mostly slept today. I really didn't have it in me to do anything else. My little niece came over and helped brighten the mood. Otherwise, it was a pretty lowkey day.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Slow Day</h4>
					<h5>Sep 7, 2025</h5>
					<p>I came up with more music today and I cleaned out my drawers. Yay! Productivity! It def helps when body doubling with a friend too. It was a pretty good day all things considered! Tomorrow I have to go out and do a ton of stuff in the outside world I've been putting off. Ah...the joys of being neurodivergent. I think I'll devote a day to really working on this site too. Till then, see ya!</p>
				</article>

					<h4>Summer's Waning</h4>
					<h5>Sep 8, 2025</h5>
					<p>Funerals have gone and passed, and I feel particularly listless about things. It's been a year now since a pretty traumatic incident, and I still don't know how to process it. Maybe I never will. I've gone back to working on Traversal for now, as well as a few newer projects for later on down the road. Fingers crossed! All I can do now is take things one day at a time, like always.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Tough Decisions</h4>
					<h5>Sep 9, 2025</h5>
					<p>I vented to my friend today about everything going on. It helped me feel better, but then it didn't. After that, we watched a movie and it actually helped me feel much better. It made me but I don't like them that way (no offense) and they have a partner anyway. I guess I've just been thinking alot of delving into that aspect of my life now, even if I have no idea how.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>A Doctor A Day</h4>
					<h5>Sep 10, 2025</h5>
					<p>I had to go to my OBGYN today for my ongoing health issues. She assured me that the issues I'm having will subside if I stick o the meds and regimen she gave. Not gonna lie, it helps me feel alot better about what's been happening. It's hard enough dealing with parts of my body I'm already uncomfortable having. I've also decided on more things for the EP I'm working on. It's mmy first so I really want to keep things as simple as possible. The last time I attempted I got obsessed over all the features of the daw I was using (Reaper) so I think this time I'll around, I'll just stick to Audacity. Hoping to release it by January! So yeah, that's all for now!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Okay Day</h4>
					<h5>Sep 11, 2025</h5>
					<p>It was an okay day. I body doubled with my friend while rereading homestuck. After that, I made a folk punk playlist for another friend. I'm looking forward to getting my pineapple uke and some of my music gear tomorrow! Hype! I am aware of today's date, but I wonder if this is the "new normal" people talk about? Hm, it's just a thought I guess. Well, until next time!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>MEENAHHH</h4>
					<h5>Sep 12, 2025</h5>
					<p>I'm rereading Homestuck with a friend and I just got up to Meenah and Caliborn. YES! Okay, that's it. That's the post, lol. See ya!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Sick and More</h4>
					<h5>Sep 13, 2025</h5>
					<p>Okay, I didn't actually make a entry today. It's really the 4th, but it's okay. I was just dealing with my ongoing problem and lost track of time. Today was pretty okay otherwise! I'm looking forward to recording my stuff for my friend's bday party too! Stay tuned!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>I Wrote a Song!</h4>
					<h5>Sep 14, 2025</h5>
					<p>I'm really bummed I couldn't record today, but my friend was really understanding about it. The upside is that I wrote a new song while my little niece and mom were making noise! I was watching Doctor Waffle clips and I guess I just kind of wanted to write something like he does, or really just something positive and encouraging with all the stuff going on right now! I'm really hoping I can record all this in time tho! Fingers crossed! See ya next time!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Songwriting Days</h4>
					<h5>Sep 15, 2025</h5>
					<p>I guess I'm going all in on this songwriting thing! I got a new ukelele and I even wrote a new song! I showed it to my friends and they really liked it! My day otherwise wasn't too great so I'm glad I had that highlight at least! That's all for now! Laters!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Rough Day</h4>
					<h5>Sep 16, 2025</h5>
					<p>I had to do something today that was many years coming, but I hope something good will come out of it. Other than that, I watched "Arsenic and Old Lace" with a friend and boy! What a movie! It's kind of crazy I never heard of it before when it had so many golden age stars for its cast! Either way, it was a really entertaining movie! Def worth a rewatch! I also learned a new fingerpicking pattern on the ukulele! Yeah, the day was rough but I was able to make the most of it! Well, that's all until next time!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Welcome to the Dark Carnival</h4>
					<h5>Sep 17, 2025</h5>
					<p>Homestuck really is something! I'm currently rereading it with a friend and I'm up to where Dirk explains everything about Earth's future to Jake. The first time I read it, I thought it was super absurd, but entertaing. Like, there's no way that could happen, right? Now, wow, I'm really not so sure. I guess I'm just trying to keep my head up for now. I guess that's all we can do. Stay strong, my friends!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Song Spree</h4>
					<h5>Sep 18, 2025</h5>
					<p>My head hurt today, but I still managed to body with a friend and make new music! I also glued by fav cup back together! I even ate a Japanese ice cream sandwich thing and got a mosquito before it bit me! Even tho I didn't feel great, it was still a pretty good day! Wel, that's all I got for now! Laters!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Busy Days</h4>
					<h5>Sep 19, 2025</h5>
					<p>I talked with Dr. D today! I also tried out the old guitar I got for fixing up! It was actually tuned out of the box! I also came up with a new song while practicing the old ones for KRT's show! I am still working on my comic, but I'mm so musically motivated rn and idk why! I'm just gonna go with it tho! Until next time! Laters</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Slow Saturday</h4>
					<h5>Sep 20, 2025</h5>
					<p>Despite the madness going on, my day was pretty slow today! I planned on doing some recording for my friend, but my family returned earlier than I thought. Phooey. I'm just hoping I can get this all down by Thursday. Fingers crossed!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Slower Day</h4>
					<h5>Sep 21, 2025</h5>
					<p>I had hoped to record today but family made it difficult. I am happy I'll at least be able to see my case worker tomorrow. All that aside, I am hoping to get more opportunities soon to create things more freely than I can now. Here's hoping! Laters!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Progress!</h4>
					<h5>Sep 22, 2025</h5>
					<p>I was able to meet with my case worker and go to the social security office today. It's rough waking up early but I'm happy we were able to get thru quickly! Tomorrow, I have to talk to one more person about my housing situation and then I'll be able to relax a little! (hopefully!) I'm really sad Bluestockings closed. I never got to go the last time my friends went bc I was sick with my ongoing problem. Sigh, I hope they're able to come back or something. It sounded like a really cool place! It'd be really cool to create a co-op or third space of some sort with my friends someday! But yeah, NYC is expensive. Until then, I guess we just gotta make the best of what we have until it's gone! Okay, y'all. Take care and be well!</p>
				</article>

					<h4>Taking Steps</h4>
					<h5>Sep 23, 2025</h5>
					<p>I did it. I talked to APS! I was so nervous I threw up this morning, but I did it! It looks like things might actually start improving for me! After that I was really tired, so I body doubled with my friend and read more Homestuck. I'm really hoping I can get in what I need to by Thursday! I'm hoping for the best! Later!</p>

					<h4>The End of Summer</h4>
					<h5>Sep 25, 2025</h5>
					<p>Summer officially ended a few nights ago, and it's now officially Fall. All the various covers of EWF's September aside, I never really talked about it. I'm not sure if I mentioned before, but I'm currently watching Osomatsu-san s4 and it's ending soon. I have so many mixed feelings about it. For starters, I miss AOP, but the OP song is still a banger. The only thing I can't get over is the 2010-era MMD look. I know they have a smaller budget than before, but it still rubs me the wrong way. Overall though, I just found the season to be extremely boring. The characters are just caricatures of themselves now. I heard they have a new director, and wow, does it show. I'm glad Call of the Night was good at least, and I'll be starting The Secret History with a friend soon after finishing Homestuck. I just hope that if this is the last season of Oso, the last episode will do the series justice. That's all for now! See ya!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Continuing...</h4>
					<h5>Sep 26, 2025</h5>
					<p>I practiced all day. Oh yeah, as for the gap in posting, I opened a automation repo on my guitar to focus more on improving my python automation skills. Random I know, but always useful! So yeah, I practced my performance for my friend's birthday show ALL DAY. I think I got better at not slurring my words as much, so that's good. But I guess, I really only have tomorrow and Sunday to get it out there. I hope I do well! It's already pretty late, so here's hoping it all turns out okay! Till next time! Later!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>I did it!</h4>
					<h5>Sep 27, 2025</h5>
					<p>I did it! I ot my performance in! Special thanks to my friend Ten for body doubling with me while I recorded. It really helped with my nerves! Now, I just need to focus on finishing Homestuck! Speaking of, I saw Vivziepop's new Pilot. It's okay, but I def have mixed feelings about how rushed it was, or how everything was introduced at once. I don't think WV or Jade should've been shown at all. If anything, I think this should've been the trailer, but maybe it's more of a promotional pilot kinda thing? I guess we'll see from here. But yeah, overall Im really proud of myself today! Later y'all!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>A Breather</h4>
					<h5>Sep 28, 2025</h5>
					<p>I took it easy today. I read some Homestuck and learned some new techniques for my ukulele! I got really into banjo vids and I figured, why not apply that stuff to the uke! I like how it sounds so far, so let's see how it goes! So yeah, that's all really. Until next time, later!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Short Post!</h4>
					<h5>Sep 29, 2025</h5>
					<p>I knew it was too good to be true! It turns out I missed Flights of Foundry this weekend! Nooooo! Oh well. It's a short post today bc I'm going to a friend's open night in Brooklyn. I'll add more later tho! Peace!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>No Spoons</h4>
					<h5>Sep 30, 2025</h5>
					<p>I'm so tired out from everything. I ended up sleeping all day today. Idk if it's bc of Fall or my anemia, but I had to take it easy today. I'm happy Jeanne signed my copy of Summer Fun last night tho! Everyone at World Trans Forum is so nice! It's def worth making the trip from Queens to go monthly! I bent my new headphones today too. Istg I'm cursed. I'm gonna try to straighten these tho and not let them get as bad as my last ones. Wish me luck and until next time, later!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Little Things</h4>
					<h5>Oct 1, 2025</h5>
					<p>Happy Oct. 1! My fav month with my fav holiday! I keep adding my entries to the header tag! Anway, today was rough but I'm happy I was able to end it by watching Perfect Blue with a friend. What a headscratcher! I'm def gonna have to rewatch it! Who is the real Mima?? But yeah, I'm glad I was able to have a good end to a otherwise bad one! I'm looking forward to tomorrow! Later!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Break Time</h4>
					<h5>Oct 7, 2025</h5>
					<p>Hey all! I think I'm gonna take a break on this blog and site. I wanna focus more on improving coding automated tasks for now. I haven't stopped working on my projects tho so stay tuned for those! Well, until next time! Later! </p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Colorful Horror!</h4>
					<h5>Oct 10, 2025</h5>
					<p>I read ch4 of The Secret History today, followed by my friend inviting me to watch The Color Out of Space! Oh wow, back to back thrills! After what's just been revealed, I can't wait to further get into The Secret History! As for the movie, I was NOT expecting any of that. I knew if was Lovecraftian but it's almost pleasant in its horror! Overall, I had a really good day! Laters!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Sick Day</h4>
					<h5>Oct 12, 2025</h5>
					<p>A got a cold or something yesterday so I'm just relaxing today. I tested myself yesterday and it wasn't covid, so I'm happy about that! Oh yeah, and I started reading "You Weren't Meant To Be Human." Crazy stuff! Now I'm just watching the Hunger Games. Goodnight all!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Feeling Better?</h4>
					<h5>Oct 13, 2025</h5>
					<p>I am still getting over my cold. I think I feel a little better tho. You Weren't Meant To Be Human can be much at times but there's this strange comfort in it. Idk how to explain. I started getting back into automation stuff for Python, esp since AtBS got updated recently. I guess we'll see where that goes. Otherwise, I mostly just slept and body doubled with my friend! I guess I'll go back to sleep now. Laters!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Feeling Better</h4>
					<h5>Oct 14, 2025</h5>
					<p>I'm feeling alot better now! I even cleaned a little this morning! I body doubled and then I watched Blade Runner 2049 wth my friend too! Idk, it was almost as confusing as Cloud Atlas! I didn't hate it tho, I think I jut need a rewatch. I worked on my comic a bit (wow!) and also back to DSA! My heart is heavy with everything that's happened recently tho, but it just motivates me to keep pushing on you know? Well, until next time! Later!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Immense Sadness</h4>
					<h5>Oct 15, 2025</h5>
					<p>Yknow those days where every bad thing that happened to you just hits you two fold? You just want to curl up and cry? Yeah it was one of those days. I'm just gonna try to be kind to myself and I'm rly glad that thru out all the pain I'm really happy for the friends I have. Thanks guys. Well, that's all I got for now! See ya!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Another Day</h4>
					<h5>Oct 16, 2025</h5>
					<p>I talked out how I was feeling with my friend and they helped me feel a little better. I know they're trying their hardest to be there for me, and I wish I did have to feel down so easy. It did help tho and I'm eternally grateful for that! It gave me a new idea for a song too! Later on we watche the NYC mayoral debate. We're both voting for Zohran, but it was still rly interestin to see Sliwa take jabs at Cuomo. But yeah, I'm going to spend the rest of the day working on Traversal and reading. Goodnight all! See ya!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>The Aftermath</h4>
					<h5>Oct 17, 2025</h5>
					<p>Cuomo's cooked. Lol awesome. It was pretty surreal also seeing him urging Zohran to denounce Hasan Piker. What's even happening now. Aside from that, I worked on Traversal some more! I'm happy bc it felt like it really stalled with everything else going on. Special thanks again for all my friends that are helping me thru everything. I love yall so much! I also got myself some sushi and an italian sub today, so everything was pretty okay. I'm gonna go now since I'm trying to sleep earlier, like the night before! Kinda (2am lol). Goodnight!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Slow Saturday</h4>
					<h5></h5>
					<p>I body doubled with my friend today and worked on Traversal. I also tried Japanese dark chocolate kit kats. They were pretty good, but they tasted alot like Pocky, which is way cheaper. I prob won't get them again. Today was a bust I guess. I don't know, I got stuff one but I still feel unfulfilled. It's interesting that today is both Mamdani's and Hamish Steele's birthday. Two of my fav parasocial people right now lol. I hope my anemia's improving. Being stuck at hom like this really sucks. Yeah, here's hoping tomorow's better. Later, y'all.</p>
