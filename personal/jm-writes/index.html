					<p>Happy birthday to my lil niece! She's 6 today! I guess I really am an unc now! I'm cool with it. What I'm not cool with tho is some sicknesses happening in the family. The most I can do is distract myself tho. Keep me in your thoughts, y'all!</p>

                	<h4>Catching Up on Anime</h3>
                	<h5>Aug 22, 2025</h4>
                	<p>Yofukashi no Uta is peak. That is all. This week's ep of Osomatsu-san wasn't bad either.</p>

					<h4>Catching Up on Anime cont.d</h3>
					<h5>Aug 23, 2025</h4>
					<p>I binged Call of the Peak's Paradse Arc. Great stuff! I missed Ko and Anko's aura farming. I'm fine if Nazuna doesn't show and we just a side series with those two tbh. Okay, back to writing stuff, lol. Oh yeah, I'm also currently reading Jeanne Thornton's Summer Fun and I'm loving it so far.</p>

					<h4>Let's go, GO-MAN!!</h4>
					<h5>Aug 26, 2025</h5>
					<p>I binged Hamish Steele's new graphic novel Go-Man in less than two hours. Oh man, so good! Also, amazing autistic and queer representation as always! I can't believe I hate to wait for the next volume! It was getting so good ðŸ˜­. Oh well, until next time!
						
					P.S: I worked on some music today as well! I'm looking forward to that!</p>

					<h4>Ordinary Day</h4>
					<h5>Aug 27, 2025</h5>
					<p>I focused mostly on writing music today and body doubling with a friend! I've also been having trouble with MS Rewards more lately. Just a lot of bugginess and false flagging of my points account. Honestly, after almost a decade, I might stop using it. Sucks. Oh well. Until next time i guess!</p>

					<h4>Precursor to the weekend</h4>
					<h5>Aug 28, 2025</h5>
					<p>I wasn't feeling great today. The bad news is I had to cancel plans I made with a friend. The good news is that I got my copy of Summer Fun! I've also started working more on my music! I'm so excited for where that will go! Talk to you soon!</p>

					<h4>Much Music, More News!</h4>
					<h5>Aug 29, 2025</h5>
					<p>Came up with more music today! I'm super excited now! Oh yeah, I'm really enjoying my new thermal sticker printer too, and it's fun coming up with new designs! I also started reading One Piece! Oh yeah, wish me luck!</p>

					<h4>Of Bodies and Health</h4>
					<h5>Aug 30, 2025</h5>
					<p>I went to Hamish Steele's virtual sign up session for Go-Man and it was great! Motivation get! In less steller news, I've been dealing with a particular health issue for a while now that's got me down. It seems like I might need surgery for it sooner than I thought. A friend told me they're sorry I have to have a body when I had to cancel on them bc of the same issue, in reference to AJJ's Body Terror Song. I really appreciated it. I really appreciate my friends.</p>
