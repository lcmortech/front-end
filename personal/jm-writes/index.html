					<p>Happy birthday to my lil niece! She's 6 today! I guess I really am an unc now! I'm cool with it. What I'm not cool with tho is some sicknesses happening in the family. The most I can do is distract myself tho. Keep me in your thoughts, y'all!</p>

					<h4>Catching Up on Anime cont.d</h3>
					<h5>Aug 23, 2025</h4>
					<p>I binged Call of the Peak's Paradse Arc. Great stuff! I missed Ko and Anko's aura farming. I'm fine if Nazuna doesn't show and we just a side series with those two tbh. Okay, back to writing stuff, lol. Oh yeah, I'm also currently reading Jeanne Thornton's Summer Fun and I'm loving it so far.</p>
